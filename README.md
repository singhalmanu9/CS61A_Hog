The code that is contained here is not guaranteed to generate the right answers or even compile properly. As such, we **highly** recommend not copying this code, since it is likely to (will) be buggy. Also, it's academic dishonesty, you will feel like an awful human being and you might even get punished. DON'T DO IT, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
